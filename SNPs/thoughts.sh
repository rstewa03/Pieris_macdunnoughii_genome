--SNPdensity <integer>

Calculates the number and density of SNPs in bins of size defined by this option. The resulting output file has the suffix ".snpden".

# call SNPs for VCF file, using Freebayes.
# will need to filter the VCF, then run this tool.

# note that we want to do this on the pseudo_chromosomal_assembly.
